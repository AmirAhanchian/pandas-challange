# In this analysis we look at the state wide scores for students in math, reading an the overall total
# The analysis looks at: 
- Highest-Performing Schools (by % Overall Passing)
- Lowest-Performing Schools (by % Overall Passing)
- Scores by School Spending
- Scores by School Size
- Scores by School Type

# Summary of findings:
- larger spending doeas not necessarily mean better grades as shown by spending amounts per students table
- the top 5 scoring schools are charter schools where as the buttom 5 are district/public schools 
- the 1000-2000 medium range schools and small schools seem to perfom much better than the 2000+ student schools, most likely due to better attention given to each individual student when the school is not over populated 
- the table for school type vs score reaffirmes that the highest scoring schools are charter schools by 36.8% which is a very large gap
